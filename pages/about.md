## About Me

I’m a Data Science and Machine Learning engineer with a background in engineering and software development. I enjoy building **end-to-end ML systems** that go beyond offline modeling — including scalable pipelines, responsible AI evaluation, and real-world deployments.

My current interests include:

- **Healthcare AI** and clinical risk modeling  
- **Graph Neural Networks** for fraud/anomaly detection  
- **LLM interpretability** and internal representation probing  
- **Computer Vision** applications in medical imaging  
- Cost-aware, explainable, and trustworthy machine learning  

I’m especially motivated by projects that translate into meaningful decisions and measurable impact in real systems.
