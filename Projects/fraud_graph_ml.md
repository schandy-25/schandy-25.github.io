## Medical Claim Fraud Detection (Graph ML)

**Technologies:** GraphSAGE, PyTorch Geometric, Anomaly Detection, Healthcare Claims Graphs  
**Impact:** Improved fraud-audit precision by **35%**

Built a large-scale **patient–provider claim graph** and trained a GraphSAGE + anomaly detection pipeline to surface suspicious claims and reduce false audits.

### Key Contributions
- Modeled heterogeneous relationships among patients, providers, and claims.
- Engineered graph features and scalable mini-batch training pipelines.
- Designed anomaly scoring to rank high-risk claims for audit prioritization.
- Achieved **+35% precision improvement** over baseline detection.
