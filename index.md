# Hi, I'm **Sandra K. Chandy** 👋  
### Data Science · Machine Learning · Healthcare AI

I build ML systems that combine **healthcare impact**, **graph neural networks**, and **model interpretability** — from skin-cancer detection apps to cost-aware readmission models and metacognitive analyses of large language models.

I’m currently pursuing my **MS in Data Science at Indiana University Bloomington** and actively building research-grade projects in applied ML.
